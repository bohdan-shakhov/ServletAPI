This project demonstrates all the basic features of servlets.
The file webapp/index.html is a welcome page with hyperlinks to other html files which in turn represent various possible Servlet APIs.
All servlets are located in the main package src/main/java/com/acolyte/servletapi and are distributed in packages with names that correspond to the functionality they demonstrate.
The same goes for html files. They are located in the directory src/main/webapp and distributed in folders with appropriate names.
